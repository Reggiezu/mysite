Software Engineering Project --- Audio Land ---

Introduction

      	My idea is to create a Web Social Media for music. App Social media continues to become a way for the masses to express themselves. With growing video platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube becoming increasingly popular, the next great website will have to follow a different approach.

Audio Land is a social media web-app for all music lovers. Our app aims to connect like-minded music fans to help curate the perfect music library. The app will also be a place for musical artists to have a chance to interact with their fans on a personal level. After users enter our site, they will be directed to setup an account. Users will create login credentials and payment info which will be encoded to the database. Users will be able to navigate through the sites after account verification. Using Spotify web APIs will allow users to share playlists and listen to music directly on the Web app.

Technologies

The Client-side (front end) is going to be using Html, CSS, and JavaScript. Potentially could be some PHP for database connection. On the server side, we will run the JavaScript web app and separately run the APIs on a Django. Our database will be SQLite. The app will deploy on Azure.
